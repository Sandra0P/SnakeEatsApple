# SnakeEatsApple
A PyGame implementation of the classic Snake Eats Apple game
The game features moving blue blocks representing the snake and a single unmoving green block representing the apple. The goal of the game is for the "snake" to eat the apple, which changes locations after every catch. 
With every apple, the snails length increases by one block. The one rule is that the snake head may not come into contact with a part of itself, otherwise the game ends.
It is possible to move through the boundaries of the screen.
